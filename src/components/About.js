        Web Components are a set of features currently being added by the W3C to the HTML and DOM specifications that
        allow for the
        creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is
        to bring
        component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and
        interoperability of individual HTML elements.
